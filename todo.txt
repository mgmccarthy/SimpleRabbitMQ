TODO
----
- create simple table(s) against which both ep's can work
- each operation can read a row, then insert a row, to mirror most of the work being done by the Mediator pattern in CRB
- load test them

- turn on Windows perf counters and see how those differ from the stats you're sending to ServicePulse
	- https://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/hosting/nservicebus-host/?version=host_7#performance-counters

- plug NewRelic packages into the ep's and take a look at the very specific message throughput stuff in NewRelic
