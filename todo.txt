TODO
----
- Get Outbox up and running
	- do one db op (insert) per handler
	- load test against the db op
	- then, play with exceptions placed in the handler in the context of the db op and the publish message going out in the command handler
		- see if this responds the way you think it will
		- add in TransactionScope to prove/disprove things the Afterman team is thinking
	- THEN, add Outbox
	- AND, find a way to share the Outbox connection with the connection that is doing the db ops
		- most likely, just using straight-up ADO might be beneficial here
	- THEN load test against Outbox ON vs. Outbox OFF
